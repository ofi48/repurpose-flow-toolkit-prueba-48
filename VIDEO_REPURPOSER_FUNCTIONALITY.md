# Video Repurposer - Complete Functionality Description

## Overview
The Video Repurposer is a sophisticated web application designed to create multiple unique variants of video files through advanced processing parameters. It transforms single videos into numerous variations by applying randomized settings within user-defined ranges, making it ideal for content creators who need to generate multiple versions of the same video with subtle differences.

## Core Architecture

### Main Interface Structure
The application uses a tabbed interface with three primary sections:
1. **Process Video** - Main processing functionality
2. **Manage Presets** - Save/load processing configurations
3. **Results** - View and download processed videos

### Processing Modes
The system supports two distinct processing workflows:

#### Single Processing Mode
- Upload one video file at a time
- Configure processing parameters
- Generate multiple variants (1-20 copies)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Immediate results viewing

#### Batch Processing Mode
- Upload multiple video files simultaneously
- Queue-based processing system
- Apply same settings to all videos in queue
- Sequential processing with status tracking
- Individual file management (remove, retry, preview)

## Processing Parameters System

### Video Quality Controls
- **Video Bitrate**: Range-based bitrate control (1000-15000 kbps)
- **Audio Bitrate**: Audio quality adjustment (64-320 kbps)
- **Frame Rate**: Video frame rate modification (24-60 fps)

### Color Adjustment Engine
- **Saturation**: Color intensity modification (0.5-1.5x)
- **Contrast**: Contrast level adjustment (0.5-1.5x)
- **Brightness**: Brightness correction (-0.3 to +0.3)
- **Gamma**: Gamma curve adjustment (0.7-1.3)

### Visual Effects Processing
- **Vignette**: Edge darkening effect (0-0.8 intensity)
- **Noise**: Film grain addition (0-0.1 intensity)
- **Waveform Shift**: Audio waveform manipulation (0-5 units)
- **Pixel Shift**: Video pixel displacement (0-5 pixels)

### Transformation Controls
- **Speed**: Playback speed modification (0.5-2.0x)
- **Zoom**: Video scaling (0.9-1.2x)
- **Rotation**: Video rotation (-10 to +10 degrees)
- **Flip Horizontal**: Mirror video horizontally

### Size and Trimming
- **Custom Pixel Size**: Specify exact video dimensions (e.g., 1280x720)
- **Random Pixel Size**: Auto-generate 9:16 aspect ratio dimensions
- **Trim Start**: Remove seconds from video beginning (0-10 seconds)
- **Trim End**: Remove seconds from video end (0-10 seconds)

### Audio Processing
- **Volume**: Audio level adjustment (0.5-1.5x)

### Special Features
- **US Metadata**: Apply region-specific metadata
- **Blurred Border**: Add blurred edge effect (0-100 pixels)

### Watermark System
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle watermark application
- **Size Control**: Watermark dimensions in pixels
- **Opacity**: Transparency level (0-1)
- **Position**: X/Y coordinates (0-1 normalized)

## Parameter Randomization Engine

### Range-Based Processing
Each parameter uses a min-max range system where:
- Users define minimum and maximum values
- System generates random values within these ranges for each video variant
- Each variant gets unique parameter combinations
- Enable/disable toggles control which parameters are randomized

### Variation Generation
When processing N copies:
- Each copy receives a unique combination of randomized parameters
- Parameters are independently randomized within their defined ranges
- Disabled parameters remain constant across all variants
- Results in visually distinct but related video variations

## Preset Management System

### Preset Storage
- Save current parameter configurations as named presets
- Load previously saved presets instantly
- Delete unwanted presets
- Presets include all parameter settings and ranges

### Preset Application
- One-click loading of saved configurations
- Maintains all parameter ranges and enable/disable states
- Allows quick switching between different processing styles

## Queue Processing System

### Queue Management
- Add multiple videos to processing queue
- Remove individual items from queue
- Clear entire queue
- Retry failed processing attempts
- Real-time status tracking for each item

### Queue Status States
- **Waiting**: Queued for processing
- **Processing**: Currently being processed
- **Completed**: Successfully processed with downloadable results
- **Error**: Processing failed with error message

### Batch Configuration
- Apply same parameter settings to all queued videos
- Set number of variations per video
- Sequential processing maintains system stability

## Results Management

### Result Display
- Grid layout showing all processed video variants
- File name and processing details for each variant
- Status indicators and download buttons
- Preview functionality for immediate viewing

### Download System
- Individual file downloads
